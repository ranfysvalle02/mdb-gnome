# .env file for local development configuration

# --- Database Connection ---

MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/ 

# --- Security and Authentication ---
# The secret key for signing JWTs. CRITICAL for security.
# MUST be changed to a strong, unique, and random value in production.
# Example: openssl rand -hex 32

# --- Default Admin User (Used ONLY if the 'users' collection is empty) ---

# --- Application/Uvicorn Settings ---
# The port the application will bind to. (Used in main.py's __main__ block)
PORT=10000

# --- General Environment Mode (Not directly used but good practice for Ray runtime_env logic) ---
